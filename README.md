Codebin (Pastebin Fork)
========

This is a fork of the original Pastebin source code from 2007. It was
published on GitHub in 2013 at github.com/lordelph/pastebin

I'll be adding a few features to the code, fixing any security bugs and
generally modifying the code to suit my needs.

Aside from this README, I'll leave the original documentation in tact until
it no longer becomes relevant.

Default is ModRewrite off and 'file' storage system as opposed to mysql

Further documentation
